# Sun-Tracking-Solar-Panel-With-an-Automatic-Cleaning-System
The Sun tracking feature allows the solar panel to follow the sun's movement throughout the day,
maximizing exposure to sunlight and enhancing overall efficiency using LDR sensors. Additionally, the
automatic cleaning system ensures that dust, dirt, and other debris are regularly removed from the panel's
surface. This proactive cleaning mechanism helps maintain optimal light absorption, preventing efficiency
losses over time. Overall, these integrated technologies contribute to increased energy output and improved
performance of solar installations
